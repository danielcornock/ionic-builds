  content: "Alexis’s work on our home is exemplary. But more than that, as a mother at home with small children, he ensured he never disturbed us and was clean, tidy and polite. In fact, sometimes I forgot he was there as he completed painting, carpentry and various other jobs with zero fuss often going above and beyond our expectations.
  
  I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Alexis."

  excerpt: Amazing!
  content: "An absolute pleasure to work with these guys, I highly recommend them!! Every day they turned up bang on 08:30 and worked long days. Communication with a builder is key and I felt totally at ease with the guys, having proper catch up chats every morning we even spoke late in the evenings. All the builders were so considerate, when our toddler needed his afternoon nap they made sure that noise levels were kept to a minimum. The initial time frame was 3 months, during the build we asked them to carry out extra work such as install new garden fencing, lay patio, paint exterior of house and put up new guttering and the guys still finished the build ahead of schedule!! Can’t recommend these guys highly enough and am looking forward to working with them again on our attic conversion."
