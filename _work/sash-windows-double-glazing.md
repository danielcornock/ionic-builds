title: 'Sash windows & Double glazing: BS6'
description: >-
  We undertook a complete overhaul of 46 sash windows in a property on the doorstep of Durdham Downs. The exterior of the windows were in desperate need of refurbishment and the only existing draught excluders were duct tape! One of the windows was rotten beyond repair.
  We installed all double-glazed units, full draught excluders and decorated each window, with new brass handles and latches, to closely match the existing furnishings throughout the property.
